\begin{exercise}[Galois connections]
  A \emph{partially ordered set}, or short \emph{poset}, is a set $A$ equipped with a reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric relation $≤$.
  A map $f:A → B$ between partially ordered sets is \emph{order preserving} if $a ≤_A a'$ implies $f(a) ≤_B f(a')$.

  A \emph{Galois connection} between two partially ordered sets is a pair of order preserving maps $g:(B,≤_B) ⇆ (A,≤_A):f$ which satisfies the following \emph{adjunction property} for all $a ∈ A$, $b ∈ B$:
  $$
  f(a) ≤_B b \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad a ≤_A g(b)
  $$
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $X$, $Y$ be sets and $R ⊆ X × Y$ a relation from $X$ to $Y$.
      Prove that the following maps form a Galois connection between the power sets of $X$ and $Y$.
      \begin{align*}
        𝒱_R : (𝒫(X),⊇) &\leftrightarrows (𝒫(Y),⊆) : ℐ_R\\
        S & \longmapsto \{y ∈ Y \mid ∀s ∈ S:s \perp y\}\\
        \{x ∈ X \mid ∀t ∈ T:x \perp t\} & \longmapsfrom T
      \end{align*}
      {\scriptsize Note that $≤_A$ is the subset relation $⊆$ and $≤_B$ the reverse subset relation $⊇$, making order preserving maps between the two powersets \emph{inclusion reversing}.}
    \item Let $K$ be a field.
      Show the existence of a Galois connection
      $$
      𝒱:(𝒫(K[x_1,\dots,x_n]),⊇) ⇆ (𝒫(𝔸^n_K),⊆):ℐ
      $$
      between the power sets of the polynomial ring $K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ and the affine space $𝔸^n_K$, such that $𝒱(S)$ is the vanishing set of $S⊆K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ and $ℐ(T)$ the vanishing ideal of $T⊆𝔸^n_K$.
    \item Let $\Idl(R)$ denote the set of ideals of a commutative ring $R$.
      Show that $ℐ(T)$ is an ideal for every $T⊆𝔸^n_K$ and conclude that the above Galois connection descends to a Galois connection $𝒱:(\Idl(K[x_1,\dots,x_n]),⊇) ⇆ (𝒫(𝔸^n_K),⊆):ℐ$.
    \item Let $\Rad(R)$ denote the set of radical ideals of a commutative ring $R$.

  Let $g:B ⇆ A:f$ be a Galois connection.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that $g∘f$ is a closure operator on $(A,≤_A)$.
    \item Show that $f∘g$ is a closure operator on $(B,≥_B)$.

\begin{exercise}[Joins and meets]
  Let $(A,≤)$ be a poset and $M⊆A$.
  An upper bound $a ∈ A$ of $M$ (that is, $m ≤ a$ for all $m ∈ M$) is called a \emph{join} or \emph{supremum} of $M$ if it satisfies the following universal property:
  $$
  ∀a' ∈ A: (∀m ∈ M:m ≤ a') ⇒ a ≤ a'
  $$
  Dually $a$ is a \emph{meet} or \emph{infimum} of $M$ if it is a join of $M$ in the poset $(A,≥)$ with reverse ordering.
  If each finite subset has a join and a meet, $A$ is called a \emph{lattice}.
  If this holds for all subsets, the lattice is said to be \emph{complete}.

    \item Show that meets and joins are unique if they exist.  In case of existence, write $⋁ M$ for the join of $M$ and $⋀ M$ for its meet.
    \item Show that the following are equivalent for a poset $A$:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item $A$ is complete.
        \item Every subset of $A$ has a meet.
        \item Every subset of $A$ has a join.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item Let $◯:A → A$ be a closure operator on a poset $(A,≤)$.
    Let $M⊆\Fix(◯)$ and regard $\Fix(◯)$ as a subposet of $(A,≤)$.
      Prove:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item A meet of $M$ in $A$ is a fixed point of $◯$.
          Moreover, it is the meet of $M$ in $\Fix(◯)$.
        \item If $M$ has a join in $A$, its image under $◯$ is the join of $M$ in $\Fix(◯)$.
        \item Deduce that $\Fix(◯)$ is a complete lattice if $A$ is.
        \item Prove that $◯(a) = ⋀ \{m ∈ \Fix(◯) \mid a ≤ m\}$ for all $a ∈ A$.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item Compute meet and join of
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item a set $M⊆𝒫(X)$ of subsets of a set $X$,
        \item a set $M⊆\Idl(R)$ of ideals of a commutative ring $R$,
        \item a set $M⊆\Rad(R)$ of radical ideals of a commutative ring $R$,
      \end{enumerate}
      and conclude that $𝒫(X)$, $\Idl(X)$ and $\Rad(X)$ are complete lattices.
  \end{enumerate}

  Recall that a \emph{homogeneous polynomial of degree $d$} is a linear combination of monomials of degree $d$ over $K$ and an ideal $𝖆⊆K[X_0,\dots,X_n]$ is a \emph{homogeneous ideal} if it admits a generating set consisting of homogeneous elements (not necessarily of the same degree).
  Write $K[X_0,\dots,X_n]_d$ for the linear subspace consisting of homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that $f ∈ K[X_0,\dots,X_n]$ is homogeneous of degree $d$ only if $f(λa_0,\dots,λa_n) = λ^d f(a_0,\dots,a_n)$ for all $a_0,\dots,a_n ∈ K$ and $λ ∈ K^×$.
      Show that the converse holds if $K$ is an infinite field.
    \item Let $𝖆⊆K[X_0,\dots,X_n]$ be an ideal.
      Show that the following assertions are equivalent.
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item The ideal $𝖆$ is homogeneous.
        \item For every $f∈𝖆$ its homogeneous components are again in $𝖆$.
        \item The ideal $𝖆$ decomposes as the direct sum $𝖆 = \bigoplus_{d≥0}𝖆 ∩ K[X_0,\dots,X_n]_d$.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item Show that intersections, sums, products and radicals of homogeneous ideals are again homogeneous.
    \item Show that a homogeneous ideal $𝖕⊆K[X_0,\dots,X_n]$ is prime if and only if for any finite family $(f_i)_{i∈\{1,\dots,r\}}$ of homogeneous elements $f_i$ with $∏_{i=1}^r f_i ∈ 𝖕$ there exists an $i ∈ \{1,\dots,r\}$ such that $f_i ∈ 𝖕$.
    \item Show that every homogeneous ideal $𝖆 ⊊ K[X_0,\dots,X_n]$ is contained in the \emph{irrelevant ideal}, the homogeneous ideal $(X_0,\dots,X_n)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[The topology on projective space]
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $X=⋃_{i ∈ I}X_i$ be a decomposition of a set $X$ into subsets, each of which are endowed with a topology $τ_i$.
      Show that there exists a unique topology $τ$ on $X$ such that $X_i ∈ τ$ and%
      \footnote{Given a topological space $X$ with topology $τ⊆𝒫(X)$ and a subset $Y⊆X$, we denote the subspace topology on $Y$ by $τ|_Y=\{U∩Y \mid U ∈ τ\}$.}
      $τ|_{X_i} = τ_i$ for all $i ∈ I$ if and only if for all $i,j ∈ I$
      \begin{itemize}
        \item $X_{ij}\coloneqq X_i ∩ X_j$ is in $τ_i$ and $τ_j$,
        \item $τ_i|_{X_{ij}} = τ_j|_{X_{ij}}$.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
  Consider projective space $ℙ^n_K$ over a field $K$, the set of lines through the origin in $𝔸^{n+1}_K$.
  For an $n$-dimensional coordinate hyperplane $𝒱(X_i) ⊆ 𝔸^{n+1}_K$ we let $U_i ⊆ ℙ^n_K$ denote the subset of all those lines which are linear complements of $𝒱(X_i)$ in $𝔸^{n+1}_K$.
  \begin{enumerate}[start=2]
    \item Find a bijection $𝔸^n_K ≅ U_i$ for each $i = \{0,\dots,n\}$, allowing us to endow each $U_i$ with a topology by transferring the Zariski topology.
    \item Show that $(U_i)_{i ∈ \{0,\dots,n\}}$ is a decomposition of $ℙ^n_K$ satisfying the conditions of (a), thus defining the \emph{Zariski topology} on $ℙ^n_K$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[Homogenization and dehomogenization]
  Let $K$ be a field.
  Denote the vector space of $(n+1)$-variate polynomials of degree at most $d$ by $K[X_0,\dots,X_n]_{≤d}\coloneqq ⊕_{i ≤ d}K[X_0,\dots,X_n]_d$.
  For each $i ∈ \{0,\dots,n\}$ and $d ≥ 0$ there is a map
  \begin{align*}
    Φ_i^{(d)} : K[X_0,\dots,X_n]_d & \longrightarrow K[X_0,\dots,\widehat{X_i},\dots,X_n]_{≤d}\\
    f & \longmapsto f(X_0,\dots,1,\dots,X_n)
  \end{align*}
  called \emph{dehomogenization with respect to $X_i$}.
    Show that each $Φ^{(d)}_i$ is $K$-linear and has a $K$-linear inverse $Ψ_i^{(d)}$ called \emph{homogenization with respect to $X_i$}.
      By identifying $K[X_0,\dots,X_n]$ with a subset of $K[X_0,\dots,X_n][X_i^{-1}]$ this inverse can be written as $Ψ^{(d)}_i(f)=X_i^d ⋅ f(\tfrac{X_0}{X_i},\dots,\widehat{\tfrac{X_i}{X_i}},\dots,\tfrac{X_n}{X_i})$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[Projective space as a quotient]
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Prove that the map $π:𝔸^{n+1}_K∖\{0\} → ℙ^n_K$ sending a point $p$ to the line $K⋅p$ through $p$ and the origin is surjective and continuous.
      We denote the image of a point $(a_0,\dots,a_n)$ under $π$ by \emph{homogeneous coordinates} $[a_0:\ldots:a_n]$.
    \item Show that $π$ is an open map.
      Conclude that $ℙ^n_K$ is the quotient of $𝔸^{n+1}_K∖\{0\}$ with respect to the scaling action of $K^×$ on $𝔸^{n+1}_K∖\{0\}$ in that it satisfies the following universal property:
      Let $α:𝔸^{n+1}_K∖\{0\} → X$ be a continuous map such that $α(λ⋅p)=α(p)$ for every $p ∈ 𝔸^{n+1}_K∖\{0\}$ and $λ∈K^×$, then there exists a unique continuous map $\overline{α}:ℙ^n_K → X$ making the following diagram commute:

\begin{exercise}[Affine cones]
  Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field and denote the polynomial ring $K[X_0,\dots,X_n]$ by $R$.
  A subset $C⊆𝔸^{n+1}_K$ is called an \emph{affine cone} in $𝔸^{n+1}_K$ if $λ⋅p ∈ C$ for all $λ ∈ K^×$ whenever $p ∈ C$.

\begin{exercise}[Projective varieties, homogeneous vanishing ideals and their associated cone]
  Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field and denote the polynomial ring $K[X_0,\dots,X_n]$ by $R$.
  Define the \emph{projective vanishing set} $𝒱_+(𝖆)\coloneqq\{ℓ ∈ ℙ^n_K \mid ∀f ∈ 𝖆 : f(ℓ) = 0\}$ of a homogeneous ideal $𝖆⊆R$. 
  A set of this form is called a \emph{projective variety}.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Check that $𝒱_+(1)=𝒱_+(X_0,\dots,X_n)=∅$.
    \item Given a homogeneous ideal $𝖆⊆R$, show that $𝒱_+(𝖆)⊆ℙ^n_K$ is closed.
  \end{enumerate}
  We want to prove that, conversely, every closed subspace of $ℙ^n_K$ is a projective variety.
  For this purpose, we define the \emph{homogeneous vanishing ideal} of a subset $Z⊆ℙ^n_K$ as $ℐ_+(Z) \coloneqq \{f ∈ R \mid ∀ ℓ ∈ Z : f(ℓ) = 0\}$.
  Furthermore, we define its \emph{associated affine cone} $C(Z)$ to be the closure of $π^{-1}(Z)$ in $𝔸^{n+1}_K$, where $π:𝔸^{n+1}_K∖\{0\} → ℙ^n_K$ is the quotient projection.
  \begin{enumerate}[start=3]
    \item Prove that $Z ↦ C(Z)$ induces a bijection
      \[
        \{\text{closed subsets of }ℙ^n_K\} \overset{\sim}{\longrightarrow} \{\text{nonzero closed affine cones in }𝔸^{n+1}_K\}.
      \]
    \item Show that $ℐ_+(Z) = ℐ(C(Z))$ for every subset $Z⊆ℙ^n_K$.
    \item We say that a homogeneous ideal $𝖆$ is \emph{relevant} if it is not the irrelevant ideal.
      Show that $C(𝒱_+(𝖆))= 𝒱(𝖆)$ for every relevant homogeneous ideal $𝖆⊆R$.
    \item Conclude that $𝒱_+(ℐ_+(Z)) = Z$ for every closed subset $Z⊆ℙ^n_K$.
