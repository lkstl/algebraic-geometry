\begin{exercise}[Galois connections]
  A \emph{partially ordered set}, or short \emph{poset}, is a set $A$ equipped with a reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric relation $≤$.
  A map $f:A → B$ between partially ordered sets is \emph{order preserving} if $a ≤_A a'$ implies $f(a) ≤_B f(a')$.

  A \emph{Galois connection} between two partially ordered sets is a pair of order preserving maps $g:(B,≤_B) ⇆ (A,≤_A):f$ which satisfies the following \emph{adjunction property} for all $a ∈ A$, $b ∈ B$:
  $$
  f(a) ≤_B b \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad a ≤_A g(b)
  $$
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $X$, $Y$ be sets and $R ⊆ X × Y$ a relation from $X$ to $Y$.
      Prove that the following maps form a Galois connection between the power sets of $X$ and $Y$.
      \begin{align*}
        𝒱_R : (𝒫(X),⊇) &\leftrightarrows (𝒫(Y),⊆) : ℐ_R\\
        S & \longmapsto \{y ∈ Y \mid ∀s ∈ S:s \perp y\}\\
        \{x ∈ X \mid ∀t ∈ T:x \perp t\} & \longmapsfrom T
      \end{align*}
      {\scriptsize Note that $≤_A$ is the subset relation $⊆$ and $≤_B$ the reverse subset relation $⊇$, making order preserving maps between the two powersets \emph{inclusion reversing}.}
    \item Let $K$ be a field.
      Show the existence of a Galois connection
      $$
      𝒱:(𝒫(K[x_1,\dots,x_n]),⊇) ⇆ (𝒫(𝔸^n_K),⊆):ℐ
      $$
      between the power sets of the polynomial ring $K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ and the affine space $𝔸^n_K$, such that $𝒱(S)$ is the vanishing set of $S⊆K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ and $ℐ(T)$ the vanishing ideal of $T⊆𝔸^n_K$.
    \item Let $\Idl(R)$ denote the set of ideals of a commutative ring $R$.
      Show that $ℐ(T)$ is an ideal for every $T⊆𝔸^n_K$ and conclude that the above Galois connection descends to a Galois connection $𝒱:(\Idl(K[x_1,\dots,x_n]),⊇) ⇆ (𝒫(𝔸^n_K),⊆):ℐ$.
    \item Let $\Rad(R)$ denote the set of radical ideals of a commutative ring $R$.
      Show that $ℐ(T)$ is radical for every $T⊆𝔸^n_K$ and conclude that the above Galois connection descends to a Galois connection $𝒱:(\Rad(K[x_1,\dots,x_n]),⊇) ⇆ (𝒫(𝔸^n_K),⊆):ℐ$.\\

  Let $g:B ⇆ A:f$ be a Galois connection.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that $g∘f$ is a closure operator on $(A,≤_A)$.
    \item Show that $f∘g$ is a closure operator on $(B,≥_B)$.

\begin{exercise}[Joins and meets]
  Let $(A,≤)$ be a poset and $M⊆A$.
  An upper bound $a ∈ A$ of $M$ (that is, $m ≤ a$ for all $m ∈ M$) is called a \emph{join} or \emph{supremum} of $M$ if it satisfies the following universal property:
  $$
  ∀a' ∈ A: (∀m ∈ M:m ≤ a') ⇒ a ≤ a'
  $$
  Dually $a$ is a \emph{meet} or \emph{infimum} of $M$ if it is a join of $M$ in the poset $(A,≥)$ with reverse ordering.
  If each finite subset has a join and a meet, $A$ is called a \emph{lattice}.
  If this holds for all subsets, the lattice is said to be \emph{complete}.

    \item Show that meets and joins are unique if they exist.  In case of existence, write $⋁ M$ for the join of $M$ and $⋀ M$ for its meet.
    \item Show that the following are equivalent for a poset $A$:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item $A$ is complete.
        \item Every subset of $A$ has a meet.
        \item Every subset of $A$ has a join.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item Let $◯:A → A$ be a closure operator on a poset $(A,≤)$.
    Let $M⊆\Fix(◯)$ and regard $\Fix(◯)$ as a subposet of $(A,≤)$.
      Prove:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item A meet of $M$ in $A$ is a fixed point of $◯$.
          Moreover, it is the meet of $M$ in $\Fix(◯)$.
        \item If $M$ has a join in $A$, its image under $◯$ is the join of $M$ in $\Fix(◯)$.
        \item Deduce that $\Fix(◯)$ is a complete lattice if $A$ is.
        \item Prove that $◯(a) = ⋀ \{m ∈ \Fix(◯) \mid a ≤ m\}$ for all $a ∈ A$.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item Compute meet and join of
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item a set $M⊆𝒫(X)$ of subsets of a set $X$,
        \item a set $M⊆\Idl(R)$ of ideals of a commutative ring $R$,
        \item a set $M⊆\Rad(R)$ of radical ideals of a commutative ring $R$,
      \end{enumerate}
      and conclude that $𝒫(X)$, $\Idl(X)$ and $\Rad(X)$ are complete lattices.
  \end{enumerate}
