\begin{exercise}[Galois connections]
  A \emph{partially ordered set}, or short \emph{poset}, is a set $A$ equipped with a reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric relation $≤$.
  A map $f:A → B$ between partially ordered sets is \emph{order preserving} if $a ≤_A a'$ implies $f(a) ≤_B f(a')$.

  A \emph{Galois connection} between two partially ordered sets is a pair of order preserving maps $g:(B,≤_B) ⇆ (A,≤_A):f$ which satisfies the following \emph{adjunction property} for all $a ∈ A$, $b ∈ B$:
  $$
  f(a) ≤_B b \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad a ≤_A g(b)
  $$
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $X$, $Y$ be sets and $R ⊆ X × Y$ a relation from $X$ to $Y$.
      Prove that the following maps form a Galois connection between the power sets of $X$ and $Y$.
      \begin{align*}
        𝒱_R : (𝒫(X),⊇) &\leftrightarrows (𝒫(Y),⊆) : ℐ_R\\
        S & \longmapsto \{y ∈ Y \mid ∀s ∈ S:s \perp y\}\\
        \{x ∈ X \mid ∀t ∈ T:x \perp t\} & \longmapsfrom T
      \end{align*}
      {\scriptsize Note that $≤_A$ is the subset relation $⊆$ and $≤_B$ the reverse subset relation $⊇$, making order preserving maps between the two powersets \emph{inclusion reversing}.}
    \item Let $K$ be a field.
      Show the existence of a Galois connection
      $$
      𝒱:(𝒫(K[x_1,\dots,x_n]),⊇) ⇆ (𝒫(𝔸^n_K),⊆):ℐ
      $$
      between the power sets of the polynomial ring $K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ and the affine space $𝔸^n_K$, such that $𝒱(S)$ is the vanishing set of $S⊆K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ and $ℐ(T)$ the vanishing ideal of $T⊆𝔸^n_K$.
    \item Let $\Idl(R)$ denote the set of ideals of a commutative ring $R$.
      Show that $ℐ(T)$ is an ideal for every $T⊆𝔸^n_K$ and conclude that the above Galois connection descends to a Galois connection $𝒱:(\Idl(K[x_1,\dots,x_n]),⊇) ⇆ (𝒫(𝔸^n_K),⊆):ℐ$.
    \item Let $\Rad(R)$ denote the set of radical ideals of a commutative ring $R$.
      Show that $ℐ(T)$ is radical for every $T⊆𝔸^n_K$ and conclude that the above Galois connection descends to a Galois connection $𝒱:(\Rad(K[x_1,\dots,x_n]),⊇) ⇆ (𝒫(𝔸^n_K),⊆):ℐ$.\\

\begin{exercise}[Closure operators]
  A \emph{closure operator} on a poset $A$ is an order preserving map $◯:A → A$ which is \emph{idempotent}, $◯(◯(a)) = ◯(a)$, and \emph{extensive}, $a ≤ ◯(a)$.

  Let $g:B ⇆ A:f$ be a Galois connection.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that $g∘f$ is a closure operator on $(A,≤_A)$.
    \item Show that $f∘g$ is a closure operator on $(B,≥_B)$.
      {\scriptsize Mind the reverse ordering!}
  \end{enumerate}

      $$
    \item The map $\sqrt{-}:\Idl(R) → \Idl(R)$ sending an ideal $𝖆⊆R$ to its radical.
      $$
      \sqrt{𝖆}\coloneqq\{r ∈ R \mid ∃n ∈ ℕ : r^n ∈ 𝖆\}
      $$
  \end{enumerate}
  Let $K$ be a field.
  Prove:
  \begin{enumerate}[start=5]
    \item $𝒱((S))=𝒱(S)$ for every subset $S⊆K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$.
    \item $𝒱(\sqrt{I})=𝒱(I)$ for every ideal $I⊆K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[Galois correspondences]
  A Galois connection $g:B ⇆ A:f$ is a \emph{Galois correspondence} if $f$ and $g$ are mutual inverses.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that a Galois connection induces a Galois correspondence between the the sets of fixed points of its associated closure operators.

  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[Joins and meets]
  Let $(A,≤)$ be a poset and $M⊆A$.
  An upper bound $a ∈ A$ of $M$ (that is, $m ≤ a$ for all $m ∈ M$) is called a \emph{join} or \emph{supremum} of $M$ if it satisfies the following universal property:
  $$
  ∀a' ∈ A: (∀m ∈ M:m ≤ a') ⇒ a ≤ a'
  $$
  Dually $a$ is a \emph{meet} or \emph{infimum} of $M$ if it is a join of $M$ in the poset $(A,≥)$ with reverse ordering.
  If each finite subset has a join and a meet, $A$ is called a \emph{lattice}.
  If this holds for all subsets, the lattice is said to be \emph{complete}.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that meets and joins are unique if they exist.  In case of existence, write $⋁ M$ for the join of $M$ and $⋀ M$ for its meet.
    \item Show that the following are equivalent for a poset $A$:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item $A$ is complete.
        \item Every subset of $A$ has a meet.
        \item Every subset of $A$ has a join.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item Let $◯:A → A$ be a closure operator on a poset $(A,≤)$.
    Let $M⊆\Fix(◯)$ and regard $\Fix(◯)$ as a subposet of $(A,≤)$.
      Prove:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item A meet of $M$ in $A$ is a fixed point of $◯$.
          Moreover, it is the meet of $M$ in $\Fix(◯)$.
        \item If $M$ has a join in $A$, its image under $◯$ is the join of $M$ in $\Fix(◯)$.
        \item Deduce that $\Fix(◯)$ is a complete lattice if $A$ is.
        \item Prove that $◯(a) = ⋀ \{m ∈ \Fix(◯) \mid a ≤ m\}$ for all $a ∈ A$.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item Compute meet and join of
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item a set $M⊆𝒫(X)$ of subsets of a set $X$,
        \item a set $M⊆\Idl(R)$ of ideals of a commutative ring $R$,
        \item a set $M⊆\Rad(R)$ of radical ideals of a commutative ring $R$,
      \end{enumerate}
      and conclude that $𝒫(X)$, $\Idl(X)$ and $\Rad(X)$ are complete lattices.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The right adjoint $g$ preserves meets: $g \left( ⋀ M \right) = ⋀ g(M)$ for all $M⊆B$.
    \item The left adjoint $f$ preserves joins: $f \left( ⋁ N \right) = ⋁ f(N)$ for all $N⊆A$.
  \end{enumerate}

  \begin{enumerate}[start=3]
    \item $𝒱(∑𝖆_i) = 𝒱(⋃𝖆_i) = ⋂𝒱(𝖆_i)$.
    \item $ℐ(⋃ T_i) = ⋂ℐ(T_i)$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Finally, suppose $𝖆,𝖇 ⊆ K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ are ideals.
  \begin{enumerate}[start=5]
    \item Prove that $𝒱(𝖆 ∩ 𝖇) = 𝒱(𝖆 ⋅ 𝖇) = 𝒱(𝖆) ∪ 𝒱(𝖇)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[Ideal operations]
  Let $R$ be a commutative ring and $𝖆,𝖇,𝖈⊆R$ ideals.

  $$
  𝖆 ⋅ 𝖇 \coloneqq (\{a ⋅ b ∈ R\mid a ∈ 𝖆, b ∈ 𝖇\}),
  $$
  and the \emph{ideal quotient}
  $$
  𝖆 : 𝖇 \coloneqq \{r ∈ R \mid r ⋅ 𝖇 ⊆ 𝖆\}.
  $$
  Show:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The intersection $𝖆 ∩ 𝖇$ is an ideal but the union $𝖆 ∪ 𝖇$ is not in general.
    \item The quotient $𝖆 : 𝖇$ is an ideal but $\{a ⋅ b ∈ R \mid a ∈ 𝖆, b ∈ 𝖇\}$ is not in general.
    \item There is a chain of inclusions $𝖆 ⋅ 𝖇 ⊆ 𝖆 ∩ 𝖇 ⊆ 𝖆 ⊆ 𝖆 + 𝖇$.
      Find counterexamples to show that the inclusions are strict in general.
    \item $\sqrt{𝖆 ⋅ 𝖇} = \sqrt{𝖆 ∩ 𝖇} = \sqrt{𝖆} ∩ \sqrt{𝖇}$.
    \item $\sqrt{𝖆 + 𝖇} = \sqrt{\sqrt{𝖆} + \sqrt{𝖇}}$.
  \end{enumerate}
