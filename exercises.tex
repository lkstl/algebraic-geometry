\begin{exercise}[Galois connections]
  A \emph{partially ordered set}, or short \emph{poset}, is a set $A$ equipped with a reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric relation $≤$.
  A map $f:A → B$ between partially ordered sets is \emph{order preserving} if $a ≤_A a'$ implies $f(a) ≤_B f(a')$.

  A \emph{Galois connection} between two partially ordered sets is a pair of order preserving maps $g:(B,≤_B) ⇆ (A,≤_A):f$ which satisfies the following \emph{adjunction property} for all $a ∈ A$, $b ∈ B$:
  $$
  f(a) ≤_B b \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad a ≤_A g(b)
  $$
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $X$, $Y$ be sets and $R ⊆ X × Y$ a relation from $X$ to $Y$.
      Prove that the following maps form a Galois connection between the power sets of $X$ and $Y$.
      \begin{align*}
        𝒱_R : (𝒫(X),⊇) &\leftrightarrows (𝒫(Y),⊆) : ℐ_R\\
        S & \longmapsto \{y ∈ Y \mid ∀s ∈ S:s \perp y\}\\
        \{x ∈ X \mid ∀t ∈ T:x \perp t\} & \longmapsfrom T
      \end{align*}
      {\scriptsize Note that $≤_A$ is the subset relation $⊆$ and $≤_B$ the reverse subset relation $⊇$, making order preserving maps between the two powersets \emph{inclusion reversing}.}
    \item Let $K$ be a field.
      Show the existence of a Galois connection
      $$
      𝒱:(𝒫(K[x_1,\dots,x_n]),⊇) ⇆ (𝒫(𝔸^n_K),⊆):ℐ
      $$

    \item Let $\Idl(R)$ denote the set of ideals of a commutative ring $R$.
      Show that $ℐ(T)$ is an ideal for every $T⊆𝔸^n_K$ and conclude that the above Galois connection descends to a Galois connection $𝒱:(\Idl(K[x_1,\dots,x_n]),⊇) ⇆ (𝒫(𝔸^n_K),⊆):ℐ$.
    \item Let $\Rad(R)$ denote the set of radical ideals of a commutative ring $R$.

  Let $g:B ⇆ A:f$ be a Galois connection.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that $g∘f$ is a closure operator on $(A,≤_A)$.
    \item Show that $f∘g$ is a closure operator on $(B,≥_B)$.

\begin{exercise}[Joins and meets]
  Let $(A,≤)$ be a poset and $M⊆A$.
  An upper bound $a ∈ A$ of $M$ (that is, $m ≤ a$ for all $m ∈ M$) is called a \emph{join} or \emph{supremum} of $M$ if it satisfies the following universal property:
  $$
  ∀a' ∈ A: (∀m ∈ M:m ≤ a') ⇒ a ≤ a'
  $$
  Dually $a$ is a \emph{meet} or \emph{infimum} of $M$ if it is a join of $M$ in the poset $(A,≥)$ with reverse ordering.
  If each finite subset has a join and a meet, $A$ is called a \emph{lattice}.
  If this holds for all subsets, the lattice is said to be \emph{complete}.

      \begin{enumerate}
        \item $A$ is complete.
        \item Every subset of $A$ has a meet.
        \item Every subset of $A$ has a join.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item Let $◯:A → A$ be a closure operator on a poset $(A,≤)$.
    Let $M⊆\Fix(◯)$ and regard $\Fix(◯)$ as a subposet of $(A,≤)$.
      Prove:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item A meet of $M$ in $A$ is a fixed point of $◯$.
          Moreover, it is the meet of $M$ in $\Fix(◯)$.
        \item If $M$ has a join in $A$, its image under $◯$ is the join of $M$ in $\Fix(◯)$.
        \item Deduce that $\Fix(◯)$ is a complete lattice if $A$ is.
        \item Prove that $◯(a) = ⋀ \{m ∈ \Fix(◯) \mid a ≤ m\}$ for all $a ∈ A$.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item Compute meet and join of
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item a set $M⊆𝒫(X)$ of subsets of a set $X$,
        \item a set $M⊆\Idl(R)$ of ideals of a commutative ring $R$,
        \item a set $M⊆\Rad(R)$ of radical ideals of a commutative ring $R$,
      \end{enumerate}

  Recall that a \emph{homogeneous polynomial of degree $d$} is a linear combination of monomials of degree $d$ over $K$ and an ideal $𝖆⊆K[X_0,\dots,X_n]$ is a \emph{homogeneous ideal} if it admits a generating set consisting of homogeneous elements (not necessarily of the same degree).
  Write $K[X_0,\dots,X_n]_d$ for the linear subspace consisting of homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Assume that $K$ is infinite.
      Show that $f ∈ K[X_0,\dots,X_n]$ is homogeneous of degree $d$ if and only if $f(λa_0,\dots,λa_n) = λ^d f(a_0,\dots,a_n)$ for all $a_0,\dots,a_n ∈ K$ and $λ ∈ K^×$.
    \item Let $𝖆⊆K[X_0,\dots,X_n]$ be an ideal.
      Show that the following assertions are equivalent.
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item The ideal $𝖆$ is homogeneous.
        \item For every $f∈𝖆$ its homogeneous components are again in $𝖆$.
        \item The ideal $𝖆$ decomposes as the direct sum $𝖆 = \bigoplus_{d≥0}𝖆 ∩ K[X_0,\dots,X_n]_d$.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item Show that intersections, sums, products and radicals of homogeneous ideals are again homogeneous.
    \item Show that a homogeneous ideal $𝖕⊆K[X_0,\dots,X_n]$ is prime if and only if for any finite family $(f_i)_{i∈\{1,\dots,r\}}$ of homogeneous elements $f_i$ with $∏_{i=1}^r f_i ∈ 𝖕$ there exists an $i ∈ \{1,\dots,r\}$ such that $f_i ∈ 𝖕$.
    \item Show that every homogeneous ideal $𝖆 ⊊ K[X_0,\dots,X_n]$ is contained in the \emph{irrelevant ideal}, the homogeneous ideal $(X_0,\dots,X_n)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[The topology on projective space]
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $X=⋃_{i ∈ I}X_i$ be a decomposition of a set $X$ into subsets, each endowed with a topology $τ_i$, and write $X_{ij}\coloneqq X_i ∩ X_j$ and%
      \footnote{Given a topological space $X$ with topology $τ⊆𝒫(X)$ and a subset $Y⊆X$, we denote the subspace topology on $Y$ by $τ|_Y=\{U∩Y \mid U ∈ τ\}$.}
      $τ_i|_{ij} \coloneqq τ_i|_{X_{ij}}$.
      Show that there exists a unique topology $τ$ on $X$ with $τ|_i \coloneqq τ|_{X_i} = τ_i$ if and only if $X_{ij}$ is open in $X_i$ and in $X_j$ and $τ_i|_{ij} = τ_j|_{ij}$ for all $i,j ∈ I$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Let $K$ be a field and consider the projective space $ℙ^n_K$, the set of lines through the origin in $𝔸^{n+1}_K$.
  For any linear form $ℓ ∈ K[X_0,\dots,X_n]_1$ we write $ℋ_ℓ \coloneqq 𝒱_+(ℓ)$ for the hyperplane in $ℙ^n_K$ defined by $ℓ$ and denote its complement by $U_ℓ \coloneqq ℙ^n_K ∖ ℋ_ℓ$.
  \begin{enumerate}[start=2]
    \item Find a bijection $𝔸^n_K ≅ U_ℓ$ for each $ℓ ∈ K[X_0,\dots,X_n]_1$.
      This allows us to endow each $U_ℓ$ with a topology by transfering the Zariski topology along this bijection.
    \item Show that $(U_ℓ)_{ℓ ∈ K[X_0,\dots,X_n]_1}$ is a decomposition of $ℙ^n_K$ satisfying the conditions of (a), thus defining a topology on $ℙ^n_K$.
    \item Let $U_i\coloneqq U_{X_i}$ be the standard open set on $ℙ^n_K$ defined by the coordinate linear forms $X_i ∈ K[X_0,\dots,X_n]_1$.
      Show that $(U_i)_{i ∈ \{0,\dots,n\}}$ already covers $ℙ^n_K$ and induces the same topology as in (c).
    \item Prove that the map $π:𝔸^{n+1}_K∖\{0\} → ℙ^n_K$ sending a point to the line through $p$ and the origin is continuous.
    \item Consider the action of $K^×$ on $𝔸^{n+1}_K$ by scaling, that is, $λ∈K^×$ sends $(a_0,\dots,a_n)$ to $(λa_0,\dots,λa_n)$.
      Denote the corresponding quotient projection $𝔸^{n+1}_K∖\{0\} → (𝔸^{n+1}_K∖\{0\})/K^×$ by $ν$ and equip $(𝔸^{n+1}_K∖\{0\})$ with the quotient topology.
      Find a homeomorphism rendering the following triangle commutative:
      \[\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=5em]
        & {𝔸^{n+1}_K∖\{0\}} \\
        {ℙ^n_K} && {(𝔸^{n+1}_K∖\{0\})/K^×}

\begin{exercise}[Affine cones]
  Let $K$ be an infinite field and write $R\coloneqq K[X_0,\dots,X_n]$.
  Recall that $K$ acts on affine space $𝔸^{n+1}_K$ by scaling, that is, $λ ∈ K$ sends $(a_0,\dots,a_n)$ to $(λa_0,\dots,λa_n)$.
  A subset $C⊆𝔸^{n+1}_K$ is an \emph{affine cone} if $λ⋅p ∈ C$ for each $λ ∈ K$ whenever $p ∈ C$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Denote the set of homogeneous ideals of $R$ which are not equal to the irrelevant ideal by $\Idl_+(R)$ and write $π:𝔸^{n+1}_K∖\{0\} → ℙ^n_K$ for the canonical projection.
      Show that there is a commutative triangle of Galois connections as follows:
